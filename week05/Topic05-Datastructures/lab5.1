b. averageAge 
    is a "float" type
c. debugMode
    is a "Boolean"
d. name
    is a "Str"
e. ages 
    is an open "list" //corrected answer is Array

    is a "dict" with a key of firstname and corresponding value of Joe
l. someone["firstname"] 
    is the value of key "firstname" which is "Joe", i.e. "str"
m. me is a complex dict
n. me["teaching"] 
    is a list of dictionaries //corrected answer is Array
o. me["teaching"][0]["semester"] 
    the type of the value "semester" of the zero key of the dict "teaching" is an "int"
p is a trick question look at it carefully
p. me["teaching"][0]["coursename"]
